    "# 2. Preprocessing, Indexing, and Approximate Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores and compares several methods for finding DNA patterns in genomic sequences, with a focus on both **exact** and **approximate** matching. I will evaluate the performance of basic and advanced algorithms, then introduce indexing methods to accelerate search efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Compare **Naive Pattern Matching** and the **Boyer-Moore Algorithm** using character and alignment counts.\n",
    "- Implement and test **K-mer Indexing** for fast exact matching.\n",
    "- Explore **Subsequence Indexing** (spaced seeds) for efficient approximate matching allowing up to 2 mismatches (no indels).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will apply these tools to a real genomic dataset, an exerpt of human chromosome 1 (`chr1.GRCh38.excerpt.fasta`), and analyze trade-offs between accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used this notebook to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 1: How many alignments does the naive exact matching algorithm try when matching the string \n",
    "`GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCCGAGG` (derived from human Alu sequences) to the excerpt of human chromosome 1?  (Don't consider reverse complements.)\n",
    "    - 799954\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 2: How many character comparisons does the naive exact matching algorithm try when matching the string `GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCCGAGG` (derived from human Alu sequences) to the excerpt of human chromosome 1?  (Don't consider reverse complements.)\n",
    "    - 799952\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 3: Question 3\n",
    "How many alignments does Boyer-Moore try when matching the string `GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCCGAGG` (derived from human Alu sequences) to the excerpt of human chromosome 1?  (Don't consider reverse complements.)\n",
    "    - 127974\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 4: How many times does the string `GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAAT` which is derived from a human Alu sequence, occur with up to 2 substitutions in the excerpt of human chromosome 1?  (Don't consider reverse complements here.)\n",
    "    - 19\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 5: How many total index hits are there when searching for occurrences of `GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAAT` with up to 2 substitutions in the excerpt of human chromosome 1?\n",

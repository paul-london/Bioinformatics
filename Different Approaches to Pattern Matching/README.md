# üß¨ Different Approaches to Pattern Matching

This project explores and compares multiple approaches for locating short DNA sequences (patterns) within a genome (text), including exact and approximate string matching algorithms and indexing strategies commonly used in bioinformatics.

## üîç Overview

- Compare **Naive Pattern Matching** and **Boyer-Moore** algorithms
- Measure and visualize **performance**:
  - Character comparisons
  - Alignment counts
- Explore **K-mer** and **Subsequence Indexing** for efficient approximate matching
- Work with real genomic data, exerpt of human chromosome 1 (`chr1.GRCh38.excerpt.fasta`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Copy the contents of this repository folder
2. In cell 4 of the Jupyter Notebook, change the variable `p` to the desired pattern to match. See notes in this cell for patterns used in the notebook. *Note: for use in index-based methods, length must be 24.*
3. Run the remaining cells to compare each pattern matching method

This project uses standard Python (3.x) with no external dependencies.

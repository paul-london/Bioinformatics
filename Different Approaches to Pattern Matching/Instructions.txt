Measuring Boyer-Moore's benefit. First, download the Python module for Boyer-Moore preprocessing:

This module provides the BoyerMoore class, which encapsulates the preprocessing info used by the boyer_moore function above. Second, download the provided excerpt of human chromosome 1:

**Third, implement versions of the naive exact matching and Boyer-Moore algorithms that additionally count and return (a) the number of character comparisons performed and (b) the number of alignments tried. Roughly speaking, these measure how much work the two different algorithms are doing.**

For a few examples to help you test if your enhanced versions of the naive exact matching and Boyer-Moore algorithms are working properly, see these notebooks:

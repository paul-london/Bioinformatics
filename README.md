# Bioinformatics Projects

Welcome to my bioinformatics projects repository! Here you will find pipelines and training resources that I've developed and worked with to streamline genomic data analysis.

## 🚀 Core Topics

- 🐍 Python Scripting  
- 🔎 NGS Data Processing  
- 🧬 Sequence Alignment  
- 🧫 Variant Calling  
- 🧪 Workflow Automation with Snakemake  

## 📦 Key Libraries & Tools Used

- 🐍 `snakemake` — Workflow management and automation  
- 🔬 `bwa` — Sequence alignment tool  
- 🔎 `samtools` — SAM/BAM file processing  
- 🧪 `bcftools` — Variant calling and VCF manipulation  
- 🐼 `pandas` — Data manipulation (optional for analysis/reporting)  
- 🔢 `numpy` — Numerical operations (optional)  

## 📁 Projects in this Repository

### NGS Variant Calling Snakemake Pipeline

A reproducible and modular Snakemake workflow for variant calling from raw paired-end FASTQ files.  
- Uses tools like BWA, SAMtools, and bcftools  
- Supports conda environments for easy dependency management  
- Includes test datasets and example configurations  
- Automates preprocessing, alignment, and variant detection  

> See the [`NGS Variant Calling Pipeline`](./NGS_Variant_Calling_Pipeline) folder for full pipeline code and documentation.

### Ipseity Bio GATK Pipeline Training

Training materials and example workflows from the Ipseity Bio GATK pipeline course.  
- Hands-on experience with the GATK best practices for variant discovery  
- Includes workflows for data preprocessing, base recalibration, and variant calling  
- Focus on reproducibility and scalability in bioinformatics analysis  

> See the [`GATK Pipeline Training (Ipseity Bio)`](./GATK_Pipeline_Training_(Ipseity_Bio)) folder for training materials and example scripts.

# Bioinformatics & Genomic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my bioinformatics projects repository.  
This collection includes **pipelines, analyses, and training resources** that I’ve developed to streamline genomic data analysis. Many projects stem from the [Genomic Data Science Specialization (Johns Hopkins University, Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science), along with hands-on work inspired by my experience in a molecular diagnostics laboratory.

Explore end-to-end projects that highlight both my **command-line bioinformatics expertise** and my **growing data science/visualization skills**.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. [Course Training & Exercises](./Genomic-Data-Science-Specialization)
- Assignments and exploratory scripts from Coursera training.  
- Focus: building strong foundations in genomic data science.

> Each subfolder includes its own README with explanations and runnable examples.

---

### 2. Pipelines
#### [GATK Pipeline Training and Prototype](./NGS-Analysis-Pipelines/GATK-Pipeline)

- Hands-on practice building pipelines following GATK best practices for variant discovery.  
- Emphasis on reproducibility and modular structure.

#### [Custom NGS Pipeline](./NGS-Analysis/Custom-NGS-Pipeline)
- A self-designed pipeline created from scratch to handle end-to-end NGS data processing.  
> Each folder includes setup instructions, command examples, and data templates.

---

### 3. Variant Summary & Visualization in R
***New Project* — statistical analysis and visual storytelling with R.**

- Summarize variant types (SNPs vs INDELs)  
- Generate chromosome-level plots & allele frequency distributions  
- Explore summary statistics with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`  

> Includes example scripts, figures, and results.

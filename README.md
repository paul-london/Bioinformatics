# Bioinformatics Projects Repository

Welcome to my bioinformatics projects repository! This repo contains pipelines and training resources that I've developed and worked with to streamline genomic data analysis.

## Projects Overview

### 1. NGS Variant Calling Snakemake Pipeline

A reproducible and modular Snakemake workflow for variant calling from raw paired-end FASTQ files.  
- Uses tools like BWA, SAMtools, and bcftools  
- Supports conda environments for easy dependency management  
- Includes test datasets and example configurations  
- Automates preprocessing, alignment, and variant detection  

> See the [`NGS Variant Calling Pipeline`](./NGS Variant Calling Pipeline) folder for full pipeline code and documentation.

### 2. Ipseity Bio GATK Pipeline Training

Training materials and example workflows from the Ipseity Bio GATK pipeline course.  
- Hands-on experience with the GATK best practices for variant discovery  
- Includes workflows for data preprocessing, base recalibration, and variant calling  
- Focus on reproducibility and scalability in bioinformatics analysis  

> See the [`GATK Pipeline Training (Ipseity Bio)`](./GATK Pipeline Training (Ipseity Bio)) folder for training materials and example scripts.

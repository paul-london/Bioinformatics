## 📁 Projects in this Repository

### 1. NGS Variant Calling Snakemake Pipeline

A reproducible and modular Snakemake workflow for variant calling from raw paired-end FASTQ files.  
- Uses tools like BWA, SAMtools, and bcftools  
- Supports conda environments for easy dependency management  
- Includes test datasets and example configurations  
- Automates preprocessing, alignment, and variant detection  

> See the [`NGS Variant Calling Pipeline`](<./NGS Variant Calling Pipeline>) folder for full pipeline code and documentation.

### 2. Ipseity Bio GATK Pipeline Training

Training materials and example workflows from the Ipseity Bio GATK pipeline course.  
- Hands-on experience with the GATK best practices for variant discovery  
- Includes workflows for data preprocessing, base recalibration, and variant calling  
- Focus on reproducibility and scalability in bioinformatics analysis  

> See the [`GATK Pipeline Training (Ipseity Bio)`](<./GATK Pipeline Training (Ipseity Bio)>) folder for training materials and example scripts.

### 3. Biopython FASTA Processing

Custom Python scripts leveraging Biopython for open reading frame (ORF) detection and DNA sequence analysis.

- Parses GenBank files and extracts sequence data
- Identifies the longest ORFs across all three reading frames
- Supports customizable start and stop codons
- Includes utilities for sequence translation and visualization

> See the [`Biopython FASTA Processing`](<./Biopython FASTA Processing>) folder for script and sample input files.

### 4. FASTA and FASTQ Pattern Matching

A lightweight Python project for searching and extracting specific nucleotide patterns from FASTA and FASTQ files.

- Implements efficient pattern matching on sequence reads
- Supports both FASTA and FASTQ input formats
- Minimal dependencies, only uses built-in Python libraries
- Includes utilities for filtering sequences based on quality scores (for FASTQ)
- Designed for easy integration into bioinformatics pipelines

> See the [`FASTA and FASTQ Naive Pattern Matching`](<./FASTA FASTQ Naive Pattern Matching>) folder for source code more information.

### 5. Different Approaches to Pattern Matching

Compare pattern matching performance and explore indexing-based approximate search strategies.

- Naive vs Boyer-Moore: alignments and character comparisons 
- K-mer and spaced-seed subsequence indexing
- Approximate matching with up to 2 mismatches

> See the [`Different Approaches to Pattern Matching`](<./Different Approaches to Pattern Matching>) folder for source code and more information.
